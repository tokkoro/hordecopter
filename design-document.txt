This project will be a Godot game called Hordecopter, where helicopter flies and shoots enemy hordes around it. It's a spiritual clone of Vampire Survivors.

It should have many upgradeable weapons that are AI generated.
 * minigun, laser, rope, grenade, homing missiles

Every run will have a different AI generated environment with a fitting set of AI generated monsters to shoot at. The monsters behaviors should have some variance (movement speed, shooting or not, move in swarms). The game should get harder over a single run until the player fails, which should take be approximately 10 minutes long.

The project folder is ./hordecopter-godot
